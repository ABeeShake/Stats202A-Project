# Stats 202A Final Project

## Objective:
Utilize county-level PPP data as well as other macroeconomic variables to predict the change in unemployment rate from 2021 Q1 to 2021 Q2-4 (average).

## Data Used:

* Firm-level PPP Loan Data - [Small Business Association](https://data.sba.gov/dataset/ppp-foia)
* Unemployment Rate by County by Month - [Federal Reserve Economic Data](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/ALAUTA1URN)
* TO BE UPDATED

## Methods:

1. Map the distribution of PPP loans across the continental US
    * Use kernel smoothing to approximate the density of PPP loans across the US
2. Use Kernel Regression to examine the relation between pairs of potential predictors
3. Select set of uncorrelated predictors to estimate change in unemployment via linear regression
